# Barun Debnath's Portfolio

🚀 SRE | Systems Engineer | Platform Engineer

## About Me

Exploring the world of **SRE**, **Systems**, and **Platform Engineering**, one system crash (oops, *incident*) at a time. When I'm not debugging or building, you'll find me buried in mangas, sipping coffee, and obsessing over *that one perfect setup*.

## Professional Journey

| Designation | Organization | Duration |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| SRE | [One2N](https://one2n.io/) | Jun'24 - Present |
| SRE | [Media.Net](https://www.media.net/) | Jul'23 - Jun'24 |
| SRE Intern | [Media.Net](https://www.media.net/) | Jan'23 - Jun'23 |

From firefighting production issues to building scalable platforms, the journey's been a wild ride!
